    <h2>1.1.3 Questions</h2>
    <p>1. It is a good idea to write code in small pieces so can check your work in smaller increments and correct it better than if you corrected it all at once.</p>
    <p>2. </p>

    <h2>1.1.5 Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. The primary advantage of using a fixed value variable is that you can have a code that has a specific value.</p>
    <p>2.</p> <pre>I was hungry
                I ate a sandwich
                I ate another sandwich
              I was no longer hungry</pre>
    <p>3.  </p>
    <h2>1.3.4 Questions</h2>
    <p>1. The relationship between if structures and glass box testing is you use glass box testing to test if structures.</p>
    <p>2. Probably however many you made as long as its coded right, and the software can handle it.</p>
    <p>3. The suites test the code so they write the test suite first because they need to make sure the ciode will do what they want it to do.</p>
    <h2>1.3.10 Game Theory</h2>
    <p>1. You could make predictions based on guess in a game like rock, paper, scissors. Like if someone played rock and you beat them with paper,
    they might play scissors because they think you'll play paper again, so you play rock; gets them every time. You can write a code that takes 
    posibilities into account and plays accordingly.</p>
    <p>2. Abstraction is when you write some complex code in an easier way to make it quicker to understand. Abstraction is useful in code because
    there are bits of code that are long but if you abstract them you only have to write like one expression and streamlines the coding process.</p>
    <p>3. The 'random' function is an abstraction, Instead of writng a bunch of code to create an algorith that selects a random integer, you can
    abstract it so you only have to write random and it shortens your coding time.</p>
