    <h2>Lightbot and a computer are both very similar becasue in order to do things they require an input. Lightbot can't get through the level without someone giving it commands to fulfil, same with a computer. Light bot and a oomputer could be different because one is a robot that moves and lights things but a computer is stationary and only computes things.  </h2>
